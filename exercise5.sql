/* 6. 5 Draw Diagram and Write Schemas
	An entity set E1 has the attributes A (primary key), B
	and C. Another entity set E2 has the attributes D
	(primary key), E and F.
	A relationship set R with cardinality many-to-many
	exists between E1 and E2. Both E1 and E2 have
	partial participation in R.
	a) Draw an E-R Diagram.
	b) Convert the E-R Diagram to Relation Schemas
	and state any foreign key constraints.
	c) The relationship set is given an attribute G. Show
	the updated E-R Diagram and the updated Relation Schemas. */
